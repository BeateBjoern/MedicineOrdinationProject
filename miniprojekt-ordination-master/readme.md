# 3rd semester - mini project 

The project contains a prototype of a prescription system that can be used to prescribe medication to citizens.

There is a dotnet solution file that can be opened in Visual Studio. These projects are included:
- **ordination-api**: An ASP.NET web API that implements the functionality to prescribe medication and to retrieve/save data in the database.
- **ordination-blazor**: A .NET Blazor frontend that utilizes the "ordination-api".
- **shared**: Shared C# model classes for the two .NET projects.
- **ordination-test**: A project demonstrating how to test with MSTest.
